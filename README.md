Student Performance Analysis & Prediction
📌 Project Overview
This project explores the factors influencing student achievement in secondary education at two Portuguese schools. Using a dataset consisting of student grades, demographic information, and social/school-related features, I implemented [Regression/Classification] models to predict the final grade (G3) in Mathematics and Portuguese subjects.

📊 Dataset Information
Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository (Student Performance Dataset)

Instances: 649

Features: 30 (including age, family size, study time, alcohol consumption, and previous grades)

Target Variables: G1 (1st period), G2 (2nd period), and G3 (Final Grade).

🛠️ Key Tasks
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Investigating correlations between social factors (like alcohol consumption or family status) and academic performance.

Data Preprocessing: Handling categorical variables through one-hot encoding and scaling numerical features.

Predictive Modeling: Training and evaluating models such as [Linear Regression, Random Forest, or KNN] to predict G3.

Feature Importance: Determining which factors (e.g., previous class failures or study time) have the highest impact on success.

🚀 Technologies Used
Python (Pandas, NumPy)

Visualizations: Seaborn, Matplotlib, Plotly

Machine Learning: Scikit-learn
